## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs requires engaging directly with users and stakeholders through methods such as interviews, focus groups, and feedback analysis. In the SNHU Travel project, for instance, user focus groups provided invaluable insights into desired features like customizable destination lists. These needs are then translated into user stories, which describe features from the user's perspective and ensure that development remains user-centered. User stories help simplify complex requirements into manageable tasks and incorporate acceptance criteria that clearly define when a feature is complete. This structure enhances communication, fosters alignment with business goals, and ensures that each feature delivers real value to the users.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs centers around Agile principles, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and continuous feedback. In future projects, I intend to incorporate Scrum elements such as Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives. These Agile ceremonies support realistic goal setting, frequent communication, and timely adjustments based on evolving priorities. Using Agile tools like JIRA will further enhance real-time task tracking and visibility across the team. Drawing inspiration from the Valpak case study, I also plan to adopt scalable frameworks like SAFe when managing larger projects, ensuring that Agile practices remain adaptable and aligned with business needs.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means maintaining open communication, collaborating effectively, and prioritizing the team's shared goals over individual achievements. Active participation in Scrum ceremonies, providing transparent progress updates, and addressing obstacles early are essential behaviors. Seeking clarification when needed, as demonstrated through proactive communications with Product Owners, strengthens alignment and prevents misunderstandings. Good team members also embrace continuous improvement by welcoming feedback during retrospectives and suggesting enhancements. As illustrated by the Valpak case study, fostering a culture of trust, empowerment, and cross-functional collaboration is critical for building high-performing Agile teams that consistently deliver value.
